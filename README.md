keep-bags is a script designed to enhance the inventory management experience for players. With a range of key features.

## Key Features

- **Expanded Inventory Capacity**: Players can carry more materials and items within their inventory, allowing for greater flexibility and resource management.

- **Props**: The script provides realistic visuals by displaying bag props on the player's back or hands, indicating that they are equipped with a bag.

- **Blacklisted Items**: A flexible option allows you to specify blacklisted items, ensuring that certain items cannot be stored in the bag. This feature helps maintain balance and prevents abuse.

- **Smooth Animation**: Opening and closing animations provide an immersive and visually appealing experience when accessing the backpack. These animations enhance realism and immersion within the game.

- **Locking System**: Bags can be equipped with a locking system, offering an additional layer of security for valuable items.

- **Prevents Exploits**: The script actively prevents the "bag in bag" exploit, ensuring fair gameplay and maintaining the integrity of the inventory system.
